It's the most costly thing—it can get us into rabbit holes, and it can get us into dark places at times because we give so much of ourselves. But it is very important for us to tap into that safely, and use that tool to our advantage in this market.`,
      `One question to ask yourself is: *What does it mean to tap into my creative energy safely? And what does it mean for me to have an opinion about a product?* A great place to start is to look at the software products you already love, and figure out why you love them. Dissect them, and reverse-engineer the product a bit.`,
